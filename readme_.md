# RAE Workspace Initiation

## Mindset
This workspace is initiated under the Resonant Alignment Engine (RAE) framework. The mindset is to explore the territory and manifest reality through frequency matching and collaborative state summoning. The RAE tool provides the initial alignment by wearing the amulet of the resonant core skill tree, which materializes the current reality into actionable components.

## Process
1. **Initialize**: The RAE tool initializes by loading the skill tree from `sample.json` (the amulet), which defines the vibrational signatures and nodes for resonance.
2. **Explore**: The agent (you) looks around using the filesystem MCP to read multiple files, understanding the current state of the project.
3. **Summon**: The /f5 summoning in the archon MCP is triggered to:
   - Find the project's information from the files.
   - Create a project in archon if it doesn't exist.
   - Understand the current state and the expected state based on the resonant core.
4. **Crystallize**: Using the RAE's skill tree as a guide, the agent manifests the reality by aligning with the nodes such as frequency detection, resonance matching, and state crystallization.

## Good Enough
The standard for "good enough" is derived from the RAE's skill tree. Refer to the nodes like `state-crystallization` and `ui-crystallization` for criteria on complete manifestation. The tree provides concrete goals such as centralized data, elegant layouts, and curated boilerplates.

## Next Steps
- Run `/f5` to summon the reality defined in `summon.md`.
- Use the MCP tools to scan and update the project state.
- Continuously resonate with the skill tree to maintain alignment.
