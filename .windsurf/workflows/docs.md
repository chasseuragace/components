CRITICAL: This workflow uses Archon for documentation analysis and insight extraction.

Core Archon Workflow Principles for Documentation Insights

The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Analysis with Archon

MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon analysis cycle before producing insights:

Check Current Document → Identify the type of document (technical, strategic, planning, or comparative).

Review Document Details → Read the content fully and note key areas (summary, insights, risks, recommendations).

Research for Context → Cross-reference related project documentation for missing or unclear information.

Extract Insights → Summarize and categorize into:

Summary

Key Insights

Todo tasks

Risks/Challenges

Recommendations

Get Next Document → Select the next document requiring analysis.

Repeat Cycle

Task Management Rules

Update all insight-extraction actions to Archon.

Maintain clear document descriptions and add extracted insights as structured notes.

DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS – verify all interpretations against project documentation.
