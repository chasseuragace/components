come to think of it we can have a template for preferences stored in the backend 
- based on the user ,the ir general preference 
    - they can use a selected preference or personalize an existing template 
- this way hte workflow need not be configurable 
    - hence declarative 

- hence we can create 2-3 template  preference 

- phase 2 , future enhancements 
- document this as phase 2 insights
